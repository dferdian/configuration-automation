configure_slicehost.sh is a basic shell script to prepare a remote 
Slicehost Ubuntu 8.04 VPS for running production Ruby on Rails apps.

The script is self contained and does not require any user input except 
the password of your target slice. In the original version, you also
need to update the target address of your slice from "fiveruns.slicehost.com"
to the address of your account.  It will take your environment from 
blank build to live, serving a sample “Hello World” application in 
about 90 seconds.

This is the original script from the FiveRuns blog post at:

It's completely ripe for cleaning up, extending and customizing for 
other Linux distros, hosting providers and application configurations.
