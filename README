configure_slicehost.sh is the original script from the FiveRuns blog 
post at: http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/9/24/rails-automation-at-slicehost  
is a basic shell script to prepare a remote Slicehost Ubuntu 8.04 VPS 
for running production Ruby on Rails 
applications.

The script is self contained and does not require any user input except 
the password of your target slice. In the original version, you also
need to update the target address of your slice from "fiveruns.slicehost.com"
to the address of your account.  It will take your environment from 
blank build to live, serving a sample “Hello World” application in 
about 90 seconds.  

It is available at: http://github.com/mmond.  It installed:
	Ruby 1.8.6 
	Rubygems 1.2
	Rails 2.1.0
	Sqlite3
	MySQL 5.0.51a
	Thin 0.8.2
	Hello World example Rails application

It's completely ripe for cleaning up, extending and customizing for 
other Linux distros, hosting providers and application configurations.

Currently in process is:  configure_slicehost_eldorado.sh which builds
on the first script.  This version of script includes the above and:
	nginx
	Capistrano
	Mongrel
	Eldorado full stack community web application
