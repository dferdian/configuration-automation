This script will connect to your server, currently supporting Ubuntu 8.0.4 8.1.0, 
install the necessary applications and libraries to serve production Ruby on Rails applications.

The original script is from the FiveRuns blog post at: http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/9/24/rails-automation-at-slicehost  
is a basic shell script to prepare a remote Slicehost Ubuntu 8.04 VPS for running production Ruby on Rails applications.

It's completely ripe for cleaning up, extending and customizing for 
other Linux distros, hosting providers and application configurations.
