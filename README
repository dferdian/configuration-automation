This script will connect to your server, currently supporting Ubuntu 8.0.4 with other targets planned, 
install the necessary applications and libraries to serve production Ruby on Rails applications and 
deploy the Eldorado community web application.  

The script and its related configuration files are an extension are a superset of the original, 
basic configuration script available at: http://github.com/mmond/configuration-automation. This version, 
v. 0.5, introduces menu driven configuration choices like the Rails application to deploy, web server and 
application layer. Possible configuration options to add in the future: different operating system target, 
Ruby/Rails/other libraries version numbers, gems, install locations, multiple targets, Puppet, others.

The original script is from the FiveRuns blog post at: http://blog.fiveruns.com/2008/9/24/rails-automation-at-slicehost  
is a basic shell script to prepare a remote Slicehost Ubuntu 8.04 VPS for running production Ruby on Rails applications.

It's completely ripe for cleaning up, extending and customizing for 
other Linux distros, hosting providers and application configurations.
