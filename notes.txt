Local client Prerequisites:  git, Capistrano, ssh


Check file permissions on dirs Cap creates, since you are root.

cap deploy:setup	## This will fail if permissions are not set 
cap deploy:check 	## Check and see how dependencies responds on 8.04

(so both above look good)

1. Have you created a database for your application? 
(Capistrano doesn't do that?)

2. Have you added a “production” section to your config/database.yml file?
(ya.  Eldorado does and I'm including an updated and pre-configured copy )

3. Have you set adequate permissions on that database for your application? 
(again, no Cap?  Rake does.  I guess I need to add an ssh handler for this)

Hmmm.  Capistrano does not copy files between the client server.  Looks like this is all handled via source control checkins from client to SCM and checkouts from SCM to server.

The server will need a public key installed to the SCM for anything non-public.
